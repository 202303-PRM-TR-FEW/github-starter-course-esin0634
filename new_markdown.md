# In love with git

From the things I've learned so for I've (like many others) fell in love with git. Although I cannot use git with its full potential ( right now I'm at 5%) I can see in the future it will be my friend :)

# Struggles and heartbreaks

Git is hard. As a concept it makes so much sense but when I try to do things with it I become completely lost. Still I'm trying to learn and keep fighting!
